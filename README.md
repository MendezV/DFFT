# Overview

The code in this repository can be used to analyze the collective motion of stationary crowds. The study of these crowds is done by binning the system and counting the number of individuals inside each bin at a given instant in time. In particular, the input to the code in this repository is a MAT-file containing a structure array with a single field. This field is a matrix in which rows correspond to time frames and columns correspond to each bin (labeled by an integer) . As such, the (i,j) entry of this matrix corresponds to the number of individuals inside bin j on frame i. With this matrix, the code returns two arrays that caracterize the density-distributions of the crowd among the bins. First, it returns f(n) a vector that character

Also, included in this repository is the code to make predictions of crowd density-distributions under new circumstances. By mixing and matching V's and f's from different experiments, one is able to reconstruct the density distribution of a crowd in an environment where V is known for a couple of individuals, but now, the number of individuals increases significantly to a known value.

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The `MGC` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

This package is supported for *Linux* operating systems. The package has been tested on the following systems:

Linux: Ubuntu 16.04  
Mac OSX:  
Windows:  

Before setting up the `MGC` package, users should have `R` version 3.4.0 or higher, and several packages set up from CRAN.

#### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 16.04

the latest version of R can be installed by adding the latest repository to `apt`:

```
sudo echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

which should install in about 20 seconds.

#### Package dependencies

Users should install the following packages prior to installing `mgc`, from an `R` terminal:

```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'reshape2', 'Rmisc', 'devtools', 'testthat', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'latex2exp', 'MASS'))
```

which will install in about 80 seconds on a recommended machine.

#### Package Versions

The `mgc` package functions with all packages in their latest versions as they appear on `CRAN` on October 15, 2017. Users can check [CRAN snapshot](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine/) for details. The versions of software are, specifically:
```
ggplot2: 2.2.1
reshape2: 1.4.2
Rmisc: 1.5
devtools: 1.13.3
testthat: 0.2.0
knitr: 1.17
rmarkdown: 1.6
latex2exp: 0.4.0
MASS: 7.3
```



# Installation Guide

From an `R` session, type:

```
require(devtools)
install_github('neurodata/mgc', build_vignettes=TRUE)  # install mgc with the vignettes
require(mgc)  # source the package now that it is set up
vignette("MGC", package="mgc")  # view one of the basic vignettes
```

The package should take approximately 20 seconds to install with vignettes on a recommended computer. 

# Demo

## MGC Demo

The `mgc` demo can be run as follows:

```
require(mgc)
set.seed(12345)
mgc.sample(mgc::test_xunif, mgc::test_ylin)$statMGC  # test with a linear relationship between x and y
```

the x data provided is by sampling 100 times from a uniform distribution on the interval [-1, 1], and the y data is formed by adding normally distributed error with variance 0.2 (indicating a linear relationship).

and is expected  to produce the following result exactly approximately *instantaneously*:

```
0.891153
```

a more interactive demo is provided in the package vignette:

```
library(mgc)
vignette("MGC", package="mgc")
```




# Instructions for Use

## MGC Use

In the below tutorial, we show the result of `MGC` to determine the relationship between the first (sepal length) and third (petal length) dimensions of the `iris` dataset, which should run in about 2 seconds:

```
library(mgc)
set.seed(12345)
res <- mgc.sample(iris[,1], iris[,3])
mgc.plot.plot_matrix(res$localCorr, title="MGC Corr Map, Sepal Length and Petal Length",
xlab="Sepal Length Neighbors", ylab="Petal Length Neighbors", legend.name = "statMGC")
print(res$statMGC)
```

with the following statistic:

```
0.7337225
```

viewing the corr map above we see that the relationship betweel Sepal and Petal Length is somewhat linear.
